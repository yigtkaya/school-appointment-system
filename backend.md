# 🚀 School Appointment System - Backend Implementation Status

## 📊 Current Status (✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE)

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization** - JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- ✅ **Middleware Stack** - Auth, CORS, request logging, exception handling
- ✅ **Database Models** - User, Teacher, Parent, Slot, Appointment models
- ✅ **Project Structure** - Well-organized FastAPI architecture
- ✅ **Exception Handling** - Custom HTTP exceptions with proper error responses

## ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations

### ✅ 1. Teachers Management (`/api/v1/teachers`) - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ `GET /` - List all teachers (with filters by subject/branch)
- ✅ `POST /` - Create teacher profile (admin only)
- ✅ `GET /{teacher_id}` - Get teacher details
- ✅ `PUT /{teacher_id}` - Update teacher profile (teacher/admin)
- ✅ `DELETE /{teacher_id}` - Remove teacher (admin only)
- ✅ `GET /user/{user_id}` - Get teacher by user ID

### ✅ 2. Parents Management (`/api/v1/parents`) - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- ✅ `GET /` - List all parents (admin/teacher only, with filters)
- ✅ `POST /` - Create parent profile (admin only)
- ✅ `GET /me` - Get current user's parent profile
- ✅ `GET /{parent_id}` - Get parent details (with authorization)
- ✅ `PUT /{parent_id}` - Update parent profile (parent/admin)
- ✅ `DELETE /{parent_id}` - Remove parent (admin only)
- ✅ `GET /user/{user_id}` - Get parent by user ID

### 📁 Implementation Files Created & Tested:
- ✅ `app/crud/teacher.py` - Teacher CRUD operations with joins
- ✅ `app/schemas/teacher.py` - Teacher validation schemas
- ✅ `app/api/routes/teachers.py` - Teacher endpoints with auth
- ✅ `app/crud/parent.py` - Parent CRUD operations with joins
- ✅ `app/schemas/parent.py` - Parent validation schemas
- ✅ `app/api/routes/parents.py` - Parent endpoints with auth
- ✅ `app/api/deps.py` - Database dependency injection
- ✅ Fixed `UserRole` enum for Pydantic compatibility
- ✅ Fixed user CRUD to generate UUIDs properly

### 🧪 Testing Results:
- ✅ All endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Authentication middleware protecting routes
- ✅ Role-based authorization functioning
- ✅ Database relationships working (User-Teacher, User-Parent)
- ✅ CRUD operations tested with real data
- ✅ API documentation available at `/docs`
